Guillaume, from Belgium, currently senior security analyst and threat hunter within Microsoft and interested in all-things security. 
The idea of this blog is just to share some work, research or thoughts on topics that drive me, generally around Threat Hunting, Detection and Response or what goes by in my head which could lead to interesting results.
